# Brief description of the contents of the report
This data set is a comprehensive record of the Summer Olympic Games from 1896
to 2024. It shows information about athletes, their performances, and the medals that
were awarded. There is a table where the variable “name of athlete” is removed 
so there is only the player id identifying them. There is also a figure that 
shows the trend of how many males and females medaled throughout the years of 
2000-2024. This can provide insight on the number of male and female winners 
for coming years. This report also shows which country had the most athletes 
received a gold medal.
